Like, if there was no Covid I think we could get coaxed out of the house more ""for the gram"" so folk to take pictures with my baby. Now all of that is gone and if I want to see folks(now and also earlier in my child's life) I will or they will go the extra mile to see the baby.  One other thing is that my child was born at the very start of the pandemic (as far as the USA is concerned, early March 2020). We had meal trains lined up for us and grandparents and aunts and uncles willing to come down and help via cleaning the home, laundry, cooking etc . None of that happened for a while and it was HARD. Parenting is hard regardless but that isolation without even a 20 minute reprieve really wore on us at the start of the pandemic when no one knew anything (like can you get it from a doorknob? Will it hurt your child?!?) I could go on, mostly I do enjoy not seeing people and having an excuse but really and especially the anti Mask simpletons I encountered at my restaurant job. Overall I love being with my wife and baby girl and the pandemic has helped me really get a routine going for our family/home more so than if I had to work my normal 50-60 hours a week away from them.

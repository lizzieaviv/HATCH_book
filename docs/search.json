not during the past month; 3 = three or more times a week\nItem 9: 0 = very good; 3 = very bad\n\nSum score of “components”\n\nFor global PSQI, a score over 5 indicates poor sleep quality\nSee below for component score calculations\n\nNo reverse scores\nOther notes:\n\nItem 1: if they listed a range of times, we took the average\nItem 2: if they listed a range of times, we took the average\nItem 3: if they listed a range of times, we took the average\nItem 4: if they listed a range of times, we took the average\nComponent 5: I replaced missing values in 5b-5j with the mean of 5b-5j and then took the sum before recoding\n\n\n\n\n\nRecode item scores/responsesCalculate component scoresCalculate Global Score\n\n\n\nItem 1Item 2Item 3Item 4Items 5-9\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  \n  ungroup()

We planned for my mother to stay to help us in that first month, and then suddenly that changed and we were completely alone. And being unable to let family and friends meet/hold the baby has been hard and isolating. So parenting itself isn't more challenging, but we're much more alone and unsupported now.",

Thus, facet items are utilized to enhance the comprehensibility of global items, thereby increasing their reliability and validity-the facet items are included solely to obtain good global measures of each Investment Model construct. The global measures of each construct are the measures that are employed in formal tests of Investment Model hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\nRelocate facet items\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n
